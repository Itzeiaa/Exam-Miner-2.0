## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Itzeiaa/exam-miner-2.0.git
cd exam-miner-2.0


## ALGORITHM (pseudocode)

1) Validate session & UI boot
   - Ensure JWT, wire up buttons/inputs, set limits. 
   - Define FIG_ALLOWED = { 'Multiple Choice', 'True or False' } so only those formats can contain [[FIG:n]] tokens.  [ref] Ó®Å0Ó®Ç

2) Read inputs
   - User provides: subject/topic/grade, total question count, selected formats, TOS rows (topic + RU/AA/HOTS %), number of sets, and (optionally) selected figures.

3) Build TOS allocation
   3.1) validateTOS(): each row must sum to 100%; all topic weights ‚âà 100%.  [ref] Ó®Å1Ó®Ç
   3.2) apportion(total, percents): largest-remainder rounding to integers.  [ref] Ó®Å2Ó®Ç
   3.3) allocateItemsByTOS(total):
        - Split total across topics by topicWeight using apportion.
        - For each topic, split its total into RU/AA/HOTS using apportion.  [ref] Ó®Å3Ó®Ç
   3.4) distributeAcrossFormats(count, selectedFormats, mustIncludeMatch):
        - Evenly divide a count across chosen formats with apportion.
        - If ‚ÄúMatching Type‚Äù was chosen but got 0, steal 1 from the largest donor format.  [ref] Ó®Å4Ó®Ç

4) Compute format totals for the whole set
   - buildFormatTotals(plan, selectedFormats):
     For each (topic √ó RU/AA/HOTS) bucket, call distributeAcrossFormats, and sum counts per format.
     If ‚ÄúMatching Type‚Äù selected but still 0, force 1 by borrowing from the largest format.  [ref] Ó®Å5Ó®Ç Ó®Å6Ó®Ç

5) Extract material + figures
   - Extract text locally (DOCX/PDF/PPTX/‚Ä¶).
   - Extract images/page snapshots; user chooses which figures to use.

6) Make a deterministic figure-to-question plan (so the AI cannot ‚Äúpick just one‚Äù)
   - makeFigureAssignment(totalsByFormat, selectedFormats, figPlan):
     a) Keep only formats in FIG_ALLOWED.
     b) Let N = number of selected figures.
     c) Walk formats in the user‚Äôs chosen order; for each format with K items, assign figures 1..min(K, remaining) to items #1..#take for that format.
     d) Stop assigning once all N figures are placed exactly once.
     e) Return a mapping: plan[format] = [{ idx: itemIndexWithinFormat, n: figureId, desc }]  [ref] Ó®Å7Ó®Ç Ó®Å8Ó®Ç

7) Generate items per format (via the model) using TOS-aware prompts
   - For each format ‚Äúfmt‚Äù with count ‚Äúc‚Äù, build the prompt and request exactly c items.
   - (Generation details omitted here; this step yields raw items as text.)

8 ) Enforce the plan on the generated items (hard rule)
   - applyFigurePlanToGeneratedItems(items, fmt, plan[fmt]):
     For each item i (1-based):
       ‚Ä¢ If i is assigned a figure n: strip any existing [[FIG:*]] from the item, inject exactly one [[FIG:n]] into the STEM using injectTokenIntoStem, and ensure only that single token remains.
       ‚Ä¢ If i is NOT assigned: strip any [[FIG:*]] tokens from that item.  [ref] Ó®Å9Ó®Ç

9) Final figure-token hygiene (safety pass)
   9.1) Enforce validity & per-figure caps without reassigning:
        ‚Ä¢ Remove tokens with invalid n (not in 1..N).
        ‚Ä¢ Keep only the first token if multiple appear.
        ‚Ä¢ If a figure exceeds its per-figure quota, drop the token.  [ref] Ó®Å10Ó®Ç Ó®Å11Ó®Ç
   9.2) Normalize placement by format:
        ‚Ä¢ Multiple Choice ‚Üí put [[FIG:n]] on its own line immediately before ‚ÄúA.‚Äù (at the end of the stem).
        ‚Ä¢ True or False ‚Üí ensure [[FIG:n]] is appended at the very end of the statement.  [ref] Ó®Å12Ó®Ç Ó®Å13Ó®Ç

10) Render to HTML
    - When rendering MCQ/TF, convert [[FIG:n]] into the actual <img> using the n-th selected figure.
    - Non-allowed formats (not in FIG_ALLOWED) have tokens stripped before rendering.  [ref] Ó®Å14Ó®Ç

11) (Optional) Generate Answer Key on the finished HTML (separate step).

12) Save/export
    - Enable Save to DB and DOCX/PDF export once content exists.


## ALGORITHMS USED IN THE CODE (what they do and where)

‚Ä¢ Largest-Remainder Integer Allocation (‚Äúapportion‚Äù)
  - Purpose: Convert percentage splits into whole-number counts while preserving totals.
  - How: floor all shares, then allocate the remaining units to the largest fractional remainders.  [ref] Ó®Å15Ó®Ç

‚Ä¢ TOS-Driven Item Allocation (‚ÄúallocateItemsByTOS‚Äù)
  - Purpose: Split the total number of questions across topics, then within each topic across RU/AA/HOTS.
  - How: Use apportion twice‚Äîfirst by topicWeight, then by RU/AA/HOTS.  [ref] Ó®Å16Ó®Ç

‚Ä¢ Format Distribution with Matching-Type Guarantee (‚ÄúdistributeAcrossFormats‚Äù)
  - Purpose: Evenly distribute each RU/AA/HOTS bucket across selected formats.
  - Edge case: If ‚ÄúMatching Type‚Äù is selected but got zero, steal 1 from the largest donor format to ensure presence.  [ref] Ó®Å17Ó®Ç

‚Ä¢ Per-Format Totals Aggregation (‚ÄúbuildFormatTotals‚Äù)
  - Purpose: Compute the final count to generate for each format (summing all TOS buckets) and re-apply the Matching-Type guarantee once at the end.  [ref] Ó®Å18Ó®Ç Ó®Å19Ó®Ç

‚Ä¢ Deterministic Figure Assignment (‚ÄúmakeFigureAssignment‚Äù)
  - Purpose: Ensure every selected image is used exactly once and tied to a specific item index in FIG_ALLOWED formats‚Äîso the AI cannot under-use images.
  - How: Walk formats in user order; assign figures 1..N to the earl
